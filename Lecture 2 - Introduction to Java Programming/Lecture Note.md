## Introduction to Java Programming
Here is an example of a simple Java program
```Java
public class App{
    public static void main(String args[])
    {
        System.out.println("Hello world!");
    }
}
```

Note:
- Public class name is equal to the file name
- At the complete Java program, there should be at least one class
-
