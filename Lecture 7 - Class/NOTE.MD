## Introduction to OOP with Class
### What is Class?
The class is a set of collection of some similar methods or objects. For example, a student is a class (which is a abstract type of an object), the actural member in the lecture room is a objects which is a complete and real useful objects with various properties.


### The concept of a class with OOP?
The concept of class has the following characteristics,
- Polymorphism
- Encapsulation

### Why we need class?
The class are often used to generate different objects to make the program more flexible and multifacted. The concept of a class enables the programmer to be more object-orientated by having the characteristics of polymorphism.

### How to use a class?
#### Creation of a Class:
A class is made by methods and properties within the class to form a , complete class frame. For example, a triangle have the characteristics of height and width. Moreover, with the height and width, the properties like area can be generated by all sort of the methods within the class.

#### Use of a Class:
##### Sample Code:
```Java
public class CRectangle{
    //Properties (Variables)
    //Declare the data members:
    int width, height;

    //Method: area
    public static int area(int wid, int height){
        int area = wid*height;
        return area;
    }
    //Method: perimeter
    public static int perimeter(int wid, int height){
        int ans_per = 2*(wid, height);
        return ans_per;
    }
}
```
##### Sample Code: Circle Properties Calcuation
```Java
public class CCircle{
    double radius;
    double final PI = 3.14159;

    public static double area(int radius){
        int area = PI * radius * radius;
        return area;
    }
}

public class App
{
    public static void main(){
        double input;

        Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);

        input = scan.nextDouble();
        CCircle Circle_Calc; //Assign a name of an object based on the class CCircle
        Circle_Calc = new CCircle(); //Create an object by using keyword "new"

        int ans_area = Circle_Calc.area(input);
        System.out.println("Here is the area of a circle: "+ ans_area);
    }
}
```
